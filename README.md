# Melanoma_Disease_Classification

### Problem statement: 
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

#### Goal:
* To predict the melanoma disease symptoms in the earlier stage to overcome the future problems due to melanoma, a skin cancer.
* We should build a model, that predicts melanoma with good accuracy and less loss factors.

## General Information
- Data creation/loading
- Data visualisation
- Basic model building
- If overfitting, build 2nd model with augmented data
- If any class imbalance, build 3rd model with best hyperparameters
- Train model using train and validation datasets
- Tune hyperparameters and observe results

## Conclusions
- The accuracy of the model increased by handling class imbalance.
- As we can see with 30 epochs, 87% accuracy on train and 71% accuracy on test. There is still overfitting happening with difference of 16.
- This can overcome by using more layers and epochs. Also by tuning learning rate and dropout percentage.
